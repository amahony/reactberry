      Peter Benjamin Parker was born in Queens to Richard and Mary Parker.While
      Peter was still an infant, his parents were assigned by the CIA to
      infiltrate the Algerian based spy ring controlled by the communist agent,
      the Red Skull. The moment the Red Skull learned that Richard and Mary were
      double agents, he had them killed by one of his agents, the Finisher, in
      an airplane crash overseas and then framed them for treason. Before their
      deaths however, Richard and Mary had another child unknown to all others
      including Peter himself, a daughter and Peter's younger sister, Teresa.

    <TabPanel name="thanos">
      Thanos was one of the last sons of A'Lars, progenitor of the second colony
      of Eternals on Titan, and Sui-San, the last survivor of the original
      settlement of Eternals in this moon. He was born with purple, hide-like
      skin and a massive body due to his Deviant Syndrome. The very first time
      his mother laid her eyes on the baby, she was driven mad and tried to kill
      him. Despite his unusual appearance and introvert nature, Thanos was well
      accepted by his peers. He was a mild-mannered intellectual that dreamed of
      becoming a scientist like his neglectful father. However, signs of his
      true nature started to creep up early on. For instance, he liked to draw
      dead animals despite vomiting at the prospect of performing a dissection.
      Thanos' life reached a tipping point when a mysterious girl convinced him
      to explore with his friends a dangerous cave to overcome his fear of
      killing.

    <TabPanel name="thor">
      Thor is the blood-son of Odin, All-Father of the Asgardians, and Jord, who
      was also known as Gaea, the goddess who was one of the Elder Gods. Odin
      sought to father a son whose power would derive from both Asgard and
      Midgard (as the Earth realm is called by Asgardians), and hence he sought
      to mate with Jord. Odin created a cave in Norway where Jord gave birth to
      Thor.[25] Months after the infant Thor was weaned, Odin brought him to
      Asgard to be raised. Odin's wife, the goddess Frigga, acted as Thor's
      mother from that time onward. Not until many decades later did Thor learn
      that Jord was his birth mother.
